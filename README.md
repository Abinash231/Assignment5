Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

How the Code Works

1. A dictionary named student_marks is created with student names and their corresponding marks.
2. The program prompts the user to enter a student's name using input().
3. It checks whether the entered name exists in the dictionary:
4. If found, it prints the student's marks.
5. If not found, it prints "Student not found."
6. The if __name__ == "__main__": block ensures the function runs when the file is executed directly.

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

How the Code Works

1. A list numbers is created using range(1, 11), resulting in a list from 1 to 10.
2. Using slicing (numbers[0:5]), the first five elements are extracted.
3. The extracted list is then reversed using the reverse() method.
4. The program prints:
  The original list,
  The extracted elements,
  The reversed extracted elements.
